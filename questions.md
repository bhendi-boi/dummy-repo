1. This is q1
2. This is q2 ...

3. Write a program to find the only non-duplicate number in an array where all other elements have been repeated even number of times. (eg. [2, 3, 7, 3, 1, 7, 7, 9, 2, 9, 7] ans-1)
4. Given a number x, check if it is a palindrome.
5. Convert given Roman numeral to integer
6. Given two sorted arrays of sizes m, n respectively. Merge the two arrays into a third sorted array of size m + n. (same question can be done with two linked lists)
7. Given a string 's' consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
8. Find all possible subsets of a given set.
9. Consider a ternary tree (each node has a maximum of 3 children). Perform inorder traversal in such a way that if a node has a prime value, it's subtrees are pruned.
10. Find the number of palindromes in a given string.
11. Consider a ladder of n steps. A monkey can climb the ladder either 1 step or 2 steps at a time. Find the number of ways in which the monkey climbs the ladder exactly.
12. Find sum of all elements in the anti-principle diagonal.
13. Given an array with both positive and negatice integers, find the subarray which gives maximum sum and return the starting and ending indices.
14. Remove all duplicates from an array in a single array traversal.
15. Given a string, print out the character with the highest frequency.
16. Write a program to emulate a 4 bit adder, input given in binary as strings.
17. Given an array and integer k, find the closest pair of elements which add up to k.
18. Implement stack data structure using queue. (try doing with single queue for a challenge)
